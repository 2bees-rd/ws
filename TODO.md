1. Handle https (need support for different domains/port numbers depending on protocol)
2. Handle authentication. Ideally via various methods
3. File uploads (ws --file name1 localpath1 --file name2 localpath2 example/service somecommand). File names can be referenced by arguments.
4. Service listing and search. 
5. Cache operations (purge, set expire time)
